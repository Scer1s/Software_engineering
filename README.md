## User Stories

### User Story #1 (Written by Zach B.)

Jill is working on homework one day and a friend asks her for help in another class that she has already taken. She knows she shared a video in the past that has a great example for reference that will help her friend, and she thinks it will help him understand it better than she could explain it. However she starts scrolling back though old discord messages and can’t find it. So instead she uses the bot and sees all the videos that she has shared and can easily pick it out and send it to her friend so he can finish his assignment.

### User Story #2 (Written by Zach B.)

Jill is working on a personal coding project and wants something to listen to. She and her friends often share music over discord and listen to things that they all like. However there’s a mountain of messages that come with this stuff. So she uses the bot to be able to look at all the links that have been shared in the discord chat and puts what she wants into a playlist.

### User Story #3 (Written by Nick C.)

Barry is moderating a discord server and realizes that people are spamming the same videos over and over.  He doesn't want the bot to fill up the database with a bunch of the video.  So he configures the bot to add a delay.

### User Story #4 (Written by Nick C.)

Barry is setting up roles for a discord server and doesn't want new people to have access to everything yet.  One of the things he wants to limit is the use of the bot.  Luckily the bot is easily configurable.  So he changes the bot so that it doesn't allow certain roles to use it.

### User Story #5 (Written by Sceris W.)

User story 1 : Mr. Booth was interacting with his community one day and needed good ways to show off content from both himself and other creators, but found it cumbersome when trying to remember the urls and keywords for them. Ever since he started using the bot, he’s able to keep a good log of the videos he has sent in the past.
### User Story #6 (Written by Sceris W.)

User story 2: One day while moderating his discord server, Mr. Booth was having people come to him about a user who was being problematic. When Mr. Booth tried to find evidence of the claims, he found himself incapable of doing so. Now he uses the discord bot which automatically logs every message sent as well as it’s sender, even if it is deleted.
