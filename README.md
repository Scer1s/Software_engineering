### Jill Valentine - Student (Written by Zach B.)

Jill is a college student that is constantly working on different coding project weather they be school related or just personal projects. She often uses discord to communicate to her school thanks to the server her school started. She also uses it to talk to other friends with more programming experience than her when she needs help. Many of her friends ask her for help when they are stuck as well.

## User Stories

### User Story #1 (Written by Zach B.)

Jill is working on homework one day and a friend asks her for help in another class that she has already taken. She knows she shared a video in the past that has a great example for reference that will help her friend, and she thinks it will help him understand it better than she could explain it. However she starts scrolling back though old discord messages and can’t find it. So instead she uses the bot and sees all the videos that she has shared and can easily pick it out and send it to her friend so he can finish his assignment.

### User Story #2 (Written by Zach B.)

Jill is working on a personal coding project and wants something to listen to. She and her friends often share music over discord and listen to things that they all like. However there’s a mountain of messages that come with this stuff. So she uses the bot to be able to look at all the links that have been shared in the discord chat and puts what she wants into a playlist.
